# Go To Here - Alfred workflow

Quickly switch the selected path in a MacOS Open/Save/Export/Move dialog based on an Alfred selection.

## Setup

Use "Configure Workflow..." to:

- edit keywords
- adjust the text of "Open" (default: `Open`), "Save" (default: `Save`), "Export" (default: `Export`), and "Move" (default: `Move`) dialog buttons to match your system's language settings (case sensitive)
- depending on the speed of your system, adjust the delay value (in milliseconds, default `250`) used between some actions

## Usage

With an Open/Save/Export/Move dialog active, invoke the workflow with one of the methods for selecting a file or folder path.

The Open/Save/Export/Move dialog should now have switched to the selected folder or file path.

### Call workflow from another workflow

Optionally use the external trigger to call this workflow from another one. For example:

1. In a separate workflow, add a List Filter, File Filter, or Script Filter. The workflow needs to output a file or folder path.
2. Add a [Call External Trigger Output](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/outputs/call-external-trigger/) for outputting the path.
3. In the settings for that output, click "Workflow Triggers..." and choose the trigger for this workflow.
